### Update
These past two months have been very busy. I started a new job, participated in two CTFs, worked on my blog, learned how to use git, got an AWS certification, and started an Ethical Hacking course on Udemy.

Although I want to jump in tell you everything new that I've been learning, I want to take a step back and tell you more about how I ended up where I am. I plan to post about my new experiences in the coming week.

### My Career So Far

#### Level 0: Noob
I graduated high school and college with a Networking AA on 2015 with help of a program called Running Start. The program allowed me to attend college during my sophomore and senior year, I was able to fulfill all my high school and AA credits. With the help of some other opportunities, I was able to get out of high due to the shorter courses. This and other opportunities allowed me to finish school with my CCNA, CCNAS, IC3, and lots of MOS certifications. The challenge I faced was not having any work experience, so as soon as I turned 18, I dove right in.

#### Level 1: Noob in training
Soon after I turned 18, I got my first job. I worked as a contracted Dispatcher at T-mobile's NOC. The job overall was simple, when an alarm came in from a cellular tower, a ticket was created and routed to a troubleshooter. A troubleshooter will then analyze the alarm and send it to a Dispatcher who then contacts a local engineer to fix the tower. All in all, the job was very easy, most of the time I was digging around T-mobile's online training and documentations. I ended up getting promoted to a troubleshooter but by that time I had made the decision to move careers. I came to the conclusion that I didn't want to continue the cellular networking path, as my initial passion was for computer networking. Additional to the career path change, the 12 hour shift made it extremely hard to do classes at my college. During my time at Tmobile, my local college came out with a Information Secur-ity BA, and soon after I applied to it. Due to the shift lengths it made it hard to adjust for morning or evening classes. I was soon after contacted by Mindtree and was offered a full-time job!

#### Level 2: Novice
Mindtree was a vendor for Microsoft. After some shuffling, I was placed in the Azure Networking Support team. I loved it. It was one of my favorite learning experience as I was able to use my academic skills to use. Our team was tasked to do Tier 5 and 4 network support cases and I got to work 1 on 1 with Azure customers with their networking issues. The troubleshooting aspect of this job was what I fell in love with. I encountered simple issues from subnet misconfiguration to troubleshooting Site-to-Site IPSec Step 1 misconfigurations. I was so excited to learn everything. I had an awesome team and was rapidly learning. But as soon as I knew, I got contacted by AWS to join as a full time employee. I could not give this up.

#### Level 3: Intermediate
The AWS Abuse team intakes abuse related reports from AWS ip range or resources. Abuse ranged from traffic related to content related reports. This job got me introduced to abusive behavior of the internet. The amount of spam emails that I had to review... although, it was a fun job! I joined the team as a Customer Support Technician. I gained experience on training new hires, creating SOPs, and developing metric dashboards. Beyond the new soft skills that I gain, I started doing more research on network security and tracking abusive account behavior. I hit another career change dilemma, I found it extremly hard to move up the ranks within the Customer Support org and knew I needed to find a position that will allow me flexibility to grow within the security field. Soon after my dad told me that Information Security team at Amazon was hiring a Tier 1 Support Engineer. I took this opportunity to get my feet into the Information Security org, this is where my road began within security, although there will be a few hurtles I will need to overcome. 

#### Level 4: Profficient
I joined the Information Security Governance team as a Support Engineer. My main task was to handle policy interpretation questions. I gained so much experience working on this team: constructing guidelines, wikis, automated metrics, and training material. The position gave me a vast amount of visibility on projects around Amazon and my specialty was classifying data. I worked closely with the Compliance, Assurance, and Tooling team for Information Security, and this put me with lots of amazing compliance folks. During my time in this team I was able to attend two SANS courses and I certified for GCIH and GPEN, this is when my aspiration to become a Security Engineer began. Although I gained a vast amount of skills within the policy team, I needed to decide between continuing in the compliance world or pursuing a chance to join a technical security team. As I finishing my BA in Information Security in 2019 and with the skills I have learned from SANS, I taught myself Python and began getting comfortable using Linux distros. This is when I was provided a chance to join Amazon's Application Security team and this is my most exciting career change yet.

#### Level 5: Professional
A few months ago I join the Amazon's Application Security team. Although I joined as a Support Engineer, I joined with the inspiration of becoming a Security Engineer. The Detections team within AppSec focuses on dynamically/statically scanning Amazon for vulnerabilities. Within a more flexible position to learn and be mentor by a team of Security Engineers, I began my own self study. This is where this blog began. As I continue to learn and grow within this industry I want to document the steps I have taken, in hopes that a reader who is or wants to be in the Information Security industry knows that they can make it too. 

In the coming year I aspire to reach the level of Hacker. Although the level system above is my own fabricated scheme. I will consider myself an Ethical Hacker ones I have passed my OSCP and become a Security Engineer at Amazon. Granting, that will just be the start of my career as a Security Engineer (A Hacker Newbie), I can't wait to learn.
