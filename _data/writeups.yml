  excerpt: "This year, we saw a dazzling application of machine learning. The OpenAI\
    \ GPT-2 exhibited impressive ability of writing coherent and passionate essays\
    \ that exceed what we anticipated current language models are able to produce.\
    \ The GPT-2 wasn\u2019t a particularly novel architecture \u2013 it\u2019s architecture\
    \ is very similar to the decoder-only transformer. The GPT2 was, however, a very\
    \ large, transformer-based language model trained on a massive dataset. In this\
    \ post, we\u2019ll look at the architecture that enabled the model to produce\
    \ its results.   "
