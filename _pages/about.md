Hello my name is Gustavo Bobbio-Hertog!

I am a Security Engineer at Amazon's Application Security team. I am leveraging this site to document my growth through the Security field and to create a forum that will allow me to share any tools/code that come my way. My academic background is in networking and webapp security and coding skills. You can find me under Discord, Reddit, or CTFs under the alias __defendergb__. 

See you around!
