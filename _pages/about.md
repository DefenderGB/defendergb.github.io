Hello my name is Gustavo Bobbio!

I work in Amazon's Application Security team, although, I just starting in this industry. I'm documenting my growth through my blog and want to share any tools/code that come my way. I have a background in networking and but I seek to improve my security skills in Web Application and Coding. You can find me under Discords, Reddit, or CTFs under the alias __defendergb__. 

Hope to see you around!
