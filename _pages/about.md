Hello my name is Gustavo Bobbio!

I am a Security Engineer in Amazon's Application Security team, although, I am just starting in this industry. The purpose for this site is for me to document my growth through this Security and for me to share any tools/code that come my way. My academic background is in networking and but I seek to improve my security skills in Web Application and Coding. You can find me under Discord, Reddit, or CTFs under the alias __defendergb__. 

Hope to see you around!
