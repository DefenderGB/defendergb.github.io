# About Me
My name is __Gustavo BH__ and I work in Information Security. Although I am just starting in this industry, I'm documenting my growth through my blog and want to share any tools/code that come my way. I have a background in networking but I seek to improve my security skills in Web Application and Coding. You can find me under Bug Bounties and CTFs under the alias __defendergb__. Hope to see you around!
