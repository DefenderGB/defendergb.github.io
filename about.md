# Hi, my name is Gustavo BH
I work in Information Security, although, I just starting in this industry. I'm documenting my growth through my blog and want to share any tools/code that come my way. I have a background in networking but I seek to improve my security skills in Web Application and Coding. You can find me under Bug Bounties and CTFs under the alias __defendergb__. Hope to see you around!
