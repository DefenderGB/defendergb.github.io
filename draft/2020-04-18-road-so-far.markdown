## Update
These past two months have been very busy. I started a new job, participated in two CTFs, worked on my blog, learned how to use git, got an AWS certificiation, and started a Ethical Hacking course on Udemy.

Although I want to jump in tell you everything new that I've been learning, I want to take a step back and tell you more about how I ended up where I am.
## My Career So Far

### Level: Noob
I graduated highschool and college with a Networking AA on 2015 with help of a program called Running Start. It allowed me to attend college during my sophmore year and due to the different lenght of courses, I was able to fullfill all my high school and AA credits. With the help of some other opportunities, I was able to get out of high school with my CCNA, CCNAS, IC3, and lots of MOS certifications. The challenge I faced was not having any work experience, so as soon as I turned 18, I dove right in.

### Level: Noob in training
Soon after I turned 18, I got my first job. I worked as a contracted Dispatcher at T-mobile's NOC. The job overall was simple, when an alarm came in from a cellular tower, a ticket was created and routed to a troubleshooter. A troubleshooter will then troubleshoot the alarm and send it to Dispachers to contact a local engineer to fix the tower. We would provide the alarm and the tower name. All in all, the job was very easy, most of the time I was digging around online training and documentations. I ended up getting promoted to a troubleshooter but by that time I hit a learning block and loss of interest as what I was learning was cellular networking. And it was very different from computer networking. I was contacted by Mindtree and was offered a full-time job!

### Level: Novice
Mindtree was a vendor for Microsoft. After some shuffling, I was placed in the Azure Networking Support team. I loved it. It was one of my favorite learning experience as I was able to use my academic skills to use. Our team was tasked to do Tier 5 and 4 Network Support, I worked 1 on 1 with customers with their networking issues and I loved the troubleshooting aspect of this job. I encountered simple issues from subnet misconfiguration to troubleshooting Site-to-Site IPSec connection. I was so excited to learn everything I could so I could solve any customer's issues. As soon as I knew, I got contacted by AWS to join their Abuse team.

### Level: Profficent
AWS Abuse team intakes abuse related reports from AWS resources. Abuse ranged from traffic related to content related reports. This job got me introduced to abusive behavior of the internet. The amount of spam emails that I had to review... although it was a fun job. I joined the team as a Customer Support Technician. I gained experience on training new hires, created SOPs, and created metric dashboards. Beyond the new soft skills that I gain, I started doing more research on network security and tracking abusive account behavior. As I hit another road block, I found an opportunity within Information Security, this is where my road began within security, although there will be a few hurtles I will need to overcome. 

### Level: Professional
I joined the Information Security Governance team as a Support Engineer. My main task was to handle policy interpretation questions. I gain so much experience working on this team, from constructing guidances, resources, automated metrics, and in-depth training material. The position gave me a vast amount of visibility on projects around Amazon and my specialty was classifying data within applications. I worked closely with the Compliance, Assurance, and Tooling team for Information Security, and was able to work with lots of very smart compliance folks. During my time in this team I was able to attent two SANS courses and certfied for GCIH and GPEN, this is what became my aspiration to become a Security Engineer. Although I gained a vast amount of skills within the policy team, I hit a road block on my growth. Finishing my BA in Information Security, I began to aspire for technical security related skills. With the skills I have learned from SANS, I taught myself Python and began getting comfortable using Linux distros.

A few months ago I join the Amazon's Application Security team. Although I joined as a Support Engineer, I joined with the inspiration of becoming a Security Engineer. The Detections team within AppSec focuses on dynamically/statically scanning Amazon for vulnerabilities. Within a more flexible position to learn and be mentor by a team of Security Engineers, I began my own self study. This is where this blog began. As I continue to learn and grow within this industry I want to document the steps I have taken, in hopes that a reader who is or wants to be in the Information Security industry knows that they can make it too. The passion to want to protect against the malicious activity that crawls through the webs.
